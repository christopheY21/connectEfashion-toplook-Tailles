# connectEfashion-toplook-tailles
### Project description
Efashion and toplook are 2 ecommerce website that wholesales clothes.

They encoded their clothings sizes in differents formats.

Efashion : 1XS,2S,2M,1L

Toplook : 1=XS+2=S+2=M+1=L

We are looking for a program that can translate the sizes between the two websites.

We will use antlr4 for this project for multiple reasons.

1 - learn antlr4

2 - more maintainable than regex

3 - More reliable
